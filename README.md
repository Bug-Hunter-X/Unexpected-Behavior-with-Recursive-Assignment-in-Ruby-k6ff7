# Ruby Recursive Assignment Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to recursive assignment in Ruby.  Recursive assignment, where an object assigns itself to one of its own attributes, can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly stack overflow errors if not handled carefully. The `bug.rb` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rb` offers a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from assigning an object to one of its own instance variables. This creates a cyclical reference which, under certain circumstances, could lead to a stack overflow during garbage collection, or other unexpected side effects. The potential for this type of bug is often hidden, making it difficult to detect through simple testing.

## Solution

The solution involves avoiding the direct self-assignment.  Appropriate checks and alternative strategies should be implemented to handle potential cyclical references. The example provided demonstrates a safe alternative to prevent this error.
